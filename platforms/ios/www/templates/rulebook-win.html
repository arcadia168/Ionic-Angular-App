            <p>To win points all you have to do is correctly predict the outcome of a fixture</p>

            <br>

            <p>Simple! right?</p>

            <br>

            <p>What's more, the earlier you make your
                predictions the more points you'll earn.
                How cool is that? You can even change your mind.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>However, remember, the closer you get to a
                fixture the amount of points you win reduces if
                you do decide to make or change a prediction.
