            <p>We all like a bit of a choice, so you can always
                make changes to your prediction</p>

            <br>

            <p>But remember that the close that you get to a fixture
                the less points you win.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>Also, you'll have to trade some points to make
                any changes pre-fixture or during a fixture.
